# 3D-Robotic-Arm

# Task 2: Design a three-dimensional robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom.

## Description

This repository contains the design and implementation of a three-dimensional robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom. The project aims to showcase advanced robotics manipulation capabilities in a controlled environment.

## Features

- **Degrees of Freedom**: The robotic arm is equipped with 5 servo motors, providing precise control over its movements.
  
- **Design Tools**: The arm's design was created using Tinkercad, an online 3D modeling tool, ensuring ease of prototyping and visualization.

## Design and Implementation

1. **Joint Configuration:** Determine the optimal arrangement of the five servo motors to achieve a wide range of motion and stability.
   
2. **Mechanical Design:** Create detailed 3D models of the arm components, including joints and gripper, to ensure robustness and lightweight construction.
